== Lua Problem write vs type


eg symbol  TokRa  from ruleList in SC
    is often a string, name of a grammar rule
    BUT when it is a Terminal, it is a function
        eg class, char or range
    AND write Chokes on function
    
Modify
    1 grammar to contain some name, marked as Terminal
        but with string type, writeable
    2. Test Terminal & Match is not that hard...
