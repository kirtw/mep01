==  Parse Overview  mep  rmep4/


^ep4go  is module control
    Sets up devlog
    Calls grammar setup and compile
    Calls ^ep4PAR - produces EarleyState Table

^ep4PAR is version 4 of Parse
    I model the Parse Algorithm as done in Lua pgm
    I even produce the exact output of Lua from mep to compare
        The second ; piece of the grammar table 
        is the string to emulate the Lua 'terminal' output exactly
