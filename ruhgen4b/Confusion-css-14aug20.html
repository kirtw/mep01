      Timing</h1>

    First, not clear how caller specifies &lt;head &lt;style&nbsp;&nbsp;
    css&nbsp; vs external file<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; now: whether devcss - ext
    filename is given as loc var (non-arg) to HGS^hgh<br>
    <br>
    Could do both &lt;head and ext css sets.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thot two srs&nbsp; css and cse (external) BUT
    this is NOT clean <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and BREAKING change - callers
    differentiating.<br>
    Current (sic) devcss value (non-null) is flag at HGS<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to decide whether to create &lt;head &lt;link to
    ext<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or whether to include the css (cant defer) <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; could defer and merge in WH^hgh with some
    effort...<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one version included a marker,
    then used to trigger and replace<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the marker with the css
    code...<br>
    <br>
    external requires&nbsp; &lt;head&nbsp; &lt;link&nbsp; to the ext css
    file<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a complicated CMS application, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there may be need for multiple
    ext files, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shared among many pages of
    similar page-type.<br>
    <br>
    If both, sequence might be important if there is redundancy-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the LAST wins as css has no
    overall scope to decide otherwise.<br>
    <br>
    Because of buffering, HTS() and HTE()&nbsp; can be created both
    before the guts.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which goes to HT()<br>
    <br>
    Further, css sr calls may be included during guts because of
    buffering<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is sometimes convenient to put the related
    code together-<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the css and the html which invokes it by class
    (and id sometimes)<br>
    <br>
    Note &lt;Head css must be ready at the time HGS^hgh is called<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but not the external css files.<br>
